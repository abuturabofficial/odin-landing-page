              The day I started learning CSS, my first reaction was, It's very
              easy. I's little incomprehensible then.

              Though I haven't started learning JavaScript yet but I have very
              good feelings about it as I already know little bit of programming
              concepts.

              It was my very first programming language I started learning
              almost a year ago, never have had motivation to complete any
              course I have taken related to it. But, now I think situation is
              different, I can pull it off easily.

          You can achieve whatever you want, don't ever lose hope or stop
          working hard. Don't worry about current failures, treat them as your
          warm-up. You will only fail, when you stop believing in yourself and
          start listening to other people's opinions.
