            <img src="images/html.png" alt="html logo" />Just like every WebDev
            aspirant he started with learning HTML first.

          <div class="card2">
            <img src="images/CSS3.svg" alt="css svg" />The day I started
            learning CSS, my first reaction was, It's very easy. I's
            incomprehensible then.
          </div>
          <div class="card3">
            <img src="images/Javascript.png" alt="Javascript logo" />Though I
            haven't started learning JavaScript yet but I have very good
            feelings about it as I already know little bit of programming
            concepts.
          </div>
          <div class="card4">
            <img src="images/python.png" alt="Python logo" />It was my very
            first programming language I started learning almost a year ago,
            never have had motivation to complete any course I have taken
            related to it. But, now I think situation is different, I can pull
            it off easily.

          You can achieve whatever you want, don't ever lose hope or stop
          working hard. Don't worry about current failures, treat them as your
          warm-up. You will only fail, when you stop believing in yourself and
          start listening to other people's opinions.
